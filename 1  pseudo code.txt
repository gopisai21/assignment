     /*  Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input,
       calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs*/
	   Start
	   Take input value from a user
       Read input number which is given by user
       Then check a user enterd value is even number or odd number
        check input number is even or odd
         (checking even number - input_number%2 == 0)
          if number is even
         calculate the square of the input number
             square = input_number * input_number
         output -> square number
                  
           else 
               number is odd
         calculate the cube of the input number
             cube = input_number * input_number * input_number
         output -> cube
