"Assignment 1: Pseudocode and Flowchart for Sorting Algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart 
for a bubble sort algorithm. Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of 
integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm
pseudo code for bubble sort

function bubbleSort(array):
    n = length of array
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from 0 to n-i-1:
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap array[j] with array[j+1]
    return array

ALgorithm
Algorithm Steps:

step1:Start from the beginning of the list and compare the first two elements. 
step2:If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
step3:Move to the next pair of elements, and so on, continuously comparing and swapping if necessary.
step4:After each iteration, the largest unsorted element will "bubble up" to its correct position.
step5:Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements until the entire list is sorted.
